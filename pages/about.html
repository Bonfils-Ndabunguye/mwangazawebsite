<h4>What kind of law enforcement officers might try to question me?<br>
You could be questioned by a variety of law enforcement officers,<br> including state or local police officers, Joint Terrorism Task Force <br> members, or federal agents from the FBI, Department of Homeland <br> Security (which includes Immigration andbr
 Customs Enforcement <br> and the Border Patrol), Drug Enforcement  Administration, Naval <br>Criminal Investigative Service, or other agencies.Do I have to answer <br> questions asked by law enforcement officers?
No. You have the <br> constitutional right to remain silent. In general, you do not have to talk  <br>to law enforcement officers (or anyone else), even if you do not feel free  <br>to walk away from the officer, you are arrested, or you are in jail. You <br>cannot be punished for refusing to answer a question. It is a good idea <br> to talk to a lawyer before agreeing to answer questions. In general, only a <br> judge can order you to answer questions</h4>
